## This is a journaling system built with Java object oriented. A project done with my group members (Dania Batrisyia Puteri and Tannussha a/p Morgan) for our Java Course.

This is a simple journaling system that can perform CRUD functions to add the date, drinks and categorize the food based on the user's selection.
